## Installation

### Manual installation

1. Upload the 'prefill-gravity-forms' folder in to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. `cd /wp-content/plugins/prefill-gravity-forms`
3. Run `composer install, NPM asset build is in version control already.
4. Activate the plugin in via the WordPress admin.

### Composer installation

1. `composer source git@github.com:OpenWebconcept/plugin-prefill-gravity-forms.git`
2. `composer require plugin/prefill-gravity-forms`
3. `cd /wp-content/plugins/prefill-gravity-forms`
4. Run `composer install`, NPM asset build is in version control already.

> Note: The composer source command mentioned in instruction step 1. might not exist. Use one of these alternatives:

#### Option A: Direct Git Clone (Recommended)

1. `cd /wp-content/plugins/`
2. `git clone git@github.com:OpenWebconcept/plugin-prefill-gravity-forms.git`
3. `cd prefill-gravity-forms`
4. Run `composer install --no-dev` (use `--no-dev` to avoid development dependencies that require additional PHP extensions)

#### Option B: Via Composer (if you have a composer.json in your WordPress root)

1. Add to your `composer.json` repositories section:
```json
{
       "repositories": [
           {
               "type": "vcs",
               "url": "git@github.com:OpenWebconcept/plugin-prefill-gravity-forms.git"
           }
       ]
   }
```

2. In your Wordpress root dir: `composer require plugin/prefill-gravity-forms`
3. `cd /wp-content/plugins/prefill-gravity-forms`
4. Run `composer install --no-dev`

**Technical Note:** The plugin uses both a custom autoloader for its own classes and Composer's autoloader for external dependencies. The Composer autoloader has been included before the custom autoloader to ensure all dependencies (like `DI\ContainerBuilder`) are available.

### Setup

1. Go to '/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gf_settings&subview=owc-gravityforms-iconnect' and configure all the required settings.

- 1. Suppliers will provide the needed certificates which need to be selected in order to make prefilling form fields work.
- 2. Suppliers will also provide an API-key, certificates password (if needed) and a base URL.
- 3. [OIN](https://logius.nl/domeinen/toegang/organisatie-identificatienummer/wat-is-het) is a unique number for organizations provided by Logius.

2. Go to the form settings of the form you want to configure.
3. Scroll down and look for the 'iConnect' panel and configure the settings.
